# FINAL PROJECT: HOMECOOK

This was the final project for our mobile course. There were no real instructions for this project other than expand upon all other lessons, so we put together our collective knowledge and interests to create this application. Our final product was Homecook, a cooking app where users sign in and can store the ingredients they currently have, search recipes based on main ingredient, and view their favorited recipes. The main elements of this project were:
1. Google Sign-on
2. Firebase storage of userid, favorite recipes (by recipe id), and ingredient
3. API call and manipulation using Repos ([The MealDB](https://themealdb.com/))
4. Implementation of other online libraries
5. Fragment backstack management
